        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript (JS)[a] is a programming language and core technology of
          the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It was created by Brendan Eich in
          1995.[6] Ninety-nine percent of websites use JavaScript on the client
          side for webpage behavior.[10] Web browsers have a dedicated
          JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are
          also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular
          runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.[11] JavaScript is a
          high-level, often just-in-time–compiled language that conforms to the
          ECMAScript standard.[12] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based
          object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm,
          supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming
          styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working
          with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and
          the Document Object Model (DOM). The ECMAScript standard does not
          include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or
          graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime
          system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O. Although Java and JavaScript
          are similar in name and syntax, the two languages are distinct and
          differ greatly in design.
